    "Say you've finally processed images on a dozen different samples, and you want to finally put your results together. Each of your different samples are in their own .hdf5 files, which are stored in their own separate folders on your computer. If you want to do your final processing, you could go to every folder, run your code, and repeat for every single one of your samples... but that would be a bit complicated. What follows is some brief sample code that would allow you to process all your folders at once."
